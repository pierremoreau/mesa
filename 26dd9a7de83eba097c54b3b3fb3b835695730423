v3:
* Fix inclusion of spirv.hpp11 to spirv.hpp;
* Drop change to api/program.cpp for removing unused variable, as already taken
  care of in patch 05.
* Make spirv_to_cpu local spirv/invocation.cpp (Francisco Jerez);
* Update process_program interface to take a std::vector instead of a pointer + length.
