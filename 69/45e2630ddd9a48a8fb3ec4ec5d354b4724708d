Changes in:
* v8: Add DEFINES to libclspirv and libclover, in autotools, as they would
      otherwise never know whether CLOVER_ALLOW_SPIRV has been defined (Dave Airlie)
* v7: Update the dependency name (meson) and the libs variable (Makefile) due
      to the replacement of llvm-spirv to the new official SPIRV-LLVM-Translator
