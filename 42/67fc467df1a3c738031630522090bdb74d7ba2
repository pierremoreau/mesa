v3:
* Remove the const on the length argument to CreateProgramWithILKHR (Francisco
  Jerez);
* Capitalize comment (Francisco Jerez);
* Store the IL as a std::vector instead of a pointer + size (Francisco Jerez);
* Remove the destructor, due to previous change;
* Remove endianness conversion, as already performed later on (Francisco Jerez);
* Introduce a free function for compile_program, which calls the right compile
  function based on the IR format (Francisco Jerez);
* Add dependency on SPIRV-Tools, as we validate the SPIR-V module fed to
  clCreateProgramWithILKHR;
* Introduce an enum for representing which IL is stored in program;
* Correctly initialise the devices associated to a program created from
  clCreateProgramWithILKHR;
* Introduce free functions for validating the SPIR-V binary, and detecting the
  IL used in the binary fed to clCreateProgramWithILKHR.
